Campaigns with goals that are too high are less likely to succeed. In Great Britain, campaigns that were under 4,000 GBP were found to be the most successful.

## Results
I recommend launching theater campaigns in the months of May or June due to the success of campaigns that have launched in those months. The worst months to launch a campaign are during the winter months from November through January.
