# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Overview
The attached excel file is an analysis of the success of Kickstarter campaigns launched world-wide. 

## Analysis
Kickstarters categorized as "theater" campaigns had the highest overall success amoung any category. Of theater campaigns, plays outperformed the musical and spaces subcategories with a count of 694 successful campaigns as opposed to 60 and 85 respectively.

The highest number of successful theater campaigns were launched in the months of May and June.

Theater campaigns with goals that are too high are less likely to succeed. The campaigns that ultimately failed had a mean goal of more than 50% that of successful campaigns with an average amount pledged that amounted to approximately 5% of the average campaign. For successful Kickstarters, the average pledge amount was higher than the mean campaign goal.

In Great Britain, campaigns that were under 4,000 GBP were found to be the most successful.

## Results
I recommend launching theater campaigns in the months of May or June due to the success of campaigns that have launched in those months. The worst months to launch a campaign are during the winter months from November through January.
