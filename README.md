# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Overview
The following analysis focuses on how to launch a successful Theater Kickstarter campaign. The data used in this analysis consists of a total of 912 theater campaigns that were launched worldwide at various times throughout the year.

Theater campaigns with goals that were too high were less likely to succeed. The Kickstarters that ultimately failed had  mean goals of more than 50% of the goals of successful campaigns. The mean amount pledged for these campaigns amounted approximately 5% of the average campaign. This amount is far lower than the average amount pledged for successful campaigns where the average pledge amount was higher than the mean campaign goal.

In Great Britain, campaigns that were under 4,000 GBP were the most successful.

## Recommendation
Based on this analysis, of the campaigns categorized as "theater" campaigns, plays are the most likely to get traction. Setting a campaign goal that is $5,000 or lower will yield a greater chance of success. A summer launch date will also increase the odds of the Kickstarter reaching its goal.
